## 📌 Executive Summary

The OCD Patient Dataset Analysis, developed using SQL, Power BI, and Excel, reveals meaningful insights into OCD demographics, diagnosis trends, and symptom patterns:

Stable Diagnosis Trends: OCD diagnoses have remained steady over time with minor fluctuations, indicating consistent detection and reporting.

Balanced Gender Distribution: The patient population is almost equally split between male and female, showing no major gender disparity.

Diverse Ethnic Representation: The majority of patients are from Caucasian, Asian, and Hispanic backgrounds, with good overall ethnic diversity.

Common Obsession Types: Harm-related, contamination, and religious obsessions are among the most frequently reported.

Frequent Compulsions: Washing, counting, and checking are the most prevalent compulsive behaviors, with washing being the highest.

Clinical Implication: These patterns highlight the need for tailored awareness, prevention, and treatment programs that address the most common symptoms and demographic factors.
